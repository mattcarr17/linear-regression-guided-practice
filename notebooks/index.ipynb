    "A key component of inferential modeling is to ensure our model meets the assumptions of linear regression. \n",

    "1. **Linearity** - The independent variables linearly predict the dependent variable (linear relationship between them).\n",

    "2. **Normality** - The model's residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity** - The residuals have a consistent variance across entire range of dependent variable\n",

    "4. **Independence** - Independent variables are not too highly correlated to one another (no multicollinearity)\n",
